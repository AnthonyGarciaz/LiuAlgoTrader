Liu provides two different notebooks for analysis: analysis of portfolio 
(by `portfolio_id`) and analysis of a trading session (by `batch_id`):

* The portfolio_ notebook generates a benchmark with SPY, 
* The batch_ notebook loads all trades and presents analysis for the trading session, including visual presentation of the trades.
