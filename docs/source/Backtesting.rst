This section describes LiuAlgoTrader back-testing capabilities. 
The framrwork comes equiped with two sets of tools: 
basic browser-based UI (using `streamlit`) and more advanced 
command-line tool coupled with `jupter notebook(s)` for analysis.

No Liability Disclaimer
-----------------------
LiuAlgoTrader is provided with sample scanners and
out-of-the-box strategies. You may choose to use it,
modify it or completely disregard it - Regardless,
LiuAlgoTrader and its Authors bare no responsibility
to any possible loses from using LiuAlgoTrader,
or any of its derivatives (on the other hand, they
also won't share your profits, if there are any).

Liu approach to back-testing
----------------------------

While the framework was designed for high-performance real-time trading 
with dynamic scanning of the stock universe, the framework comes equiped with 
a full stack of back-testing features. 

LiuAlgoTrader framework provides two different approaches to back-testi×žg:

- Given a day-trading session (which is representaed by a `batch-id` UUID), replay the trading session on the scanned stocks, minute-by-minute while executing modified versions of the strategies. This is a very useful approach to debug & improve strategies while comparing results to a base-line. The replay can be narrowed to only traded stocks (from the corum of scanned stocks), or even focus on a specific stock. The original day-trading session can be on a paper-account, or a live trading session,
- Run strategies over long period of time, on fixed scanners (e.g. similar to how Zipline operates). Back-testing can be done on minute-by-minute or daily resolution,

Picking the right back-testing tools
************************************

Day-trading sessions allow running scanners repeatedly, over the universe of 
stocks and select stocks for trading. Strategies receive feeds of the selected 
stocks and decide how to act upon them. Swing-trading on the other hand do not 
act on second, or even minute resolutions. Back-testing entire trading days, 
second by second on the entire stock universe can be done, however it requires 
downloading of massive amounts of data, and computation power and is 
not avaliable out of the box w/ the provided momenum scanner. For more details 
on how to customize scanners to achieve such behavior, see the `Scanners` 
documentation page. 

 
Perfecting a day-trading strategy can be done by running LiuAlgoTrader framework 
on a paper-account, followed by back-testing using thereplay approach. Such back-testing sessions allow improving strategies, 
but are less effective on scanners.  

Swing-trading on selected stocks can be effectivly done while back-testing 
strategies over long period of data. For swing-trading it is less effective to
replay a specific trading-session, since the bigger picture matter more. 

Back-testing for Swing-trading is avaliable out of the box, and does not require
specliazed scanners or hardware.

Word of caution
***************

Day-trading is hard, perfecting day-trading algorithms is harder.
When replaying a day-trading session try to me minded to over-fitting and 
**hindsight bias**. Make it a habbit to always re-run strategy modifications 
on a large number of day-trading sessions, and avoid making alterations 
to fit a specific less-successful trading day. The more you day-trade on a
paper-account, the more data you collect, which in turn make the back-testing 
more effective. Last but not least, make small incremental changes, each time 
on a single parameter and progress slowly.


*backtester* for Day-Trading
----------------------------

This sub-section focus on the tools for re-running past trading sessions on 
revised strategies.

The tool comes in two 'favours': command-line tool and a browser-based UI 
using `streamlit`. The functionality of both tools is not exactly the same, 
please read the details below.

**NOTE:** While the `trader` application acts on events per-second, 
the `backtester` application runs on per-minute data.

Prerequisites
*************
1. Installed and configured Liu Algo Tradring Framework.
2. An exiting *tradeplan.toml* at the folder where the trader application is executed. For more details on how to setup the trade plan configuration file, see  `How to Configure` section,
3. [Optional] The batch-id (UUID) of a trade session to replay.

Command-line tool
*****************

To run the `backtester` application type:

.. code-block:: bash

    backtester

Displays a high-level description of the tool, and it's different parameters. 
The version you will be running might include more options then the below:

.. image:: /images/backtester1.png
    :width: 800
    :align: left
    :alt: *backtester* usage


If you had run a `trader` session  (or have used `liu quickstart` wizard) the
database should should hold at least one batch-id.

To get a list of previous trading sessions, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    backtester batch --batch-list

An example output:

.. image:: /images/backtester2.png
    :width: 800
    :align: left
    :alt: *backtester* batch-list

|br|

When running a back-test session, it's possible to
re-run strategies on all symbols selected by the scanners
for that trading session, or limit the back-test session
only to stocks actually traded by strategies on that
specific batch-id. To limit the back-test session to
actually traded symbols use the `--strict` command-line option.


Below is a sample output of a running `backtester batch`:

    :alt: *backtester* sample run

**Notes**:

1. A backtest session creates a new `batch-id`. This is helpful when running analysis of a backtest session. See the Analysis section for more details.
2. Strategies running in a backtesting session are marked with `BACKTEST` environment when logging trades, this is helpful to distinguish between backtest trades, paper and live trades when querying the database.
3. When the `backtester` application starts, it lists all the stocks picked by the scanners during the trading session.
4. `backtester` re-runs each session, by loading per-minute candles for the stock trading session (up to one week back). This reply simulates per-minute trading, vs. per-second trading during `trader` execution (though, the `trader` application can also be configured to execute strategies per minute and not per secord).
5.  `backtester` supports a debug mode, per symbol. The debug flag is passed to the implementation for `Strategy.run()`, allowing more verbose logging during backtesting.

Understanding command-line parameters
*************************************


+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter Name | Description                                           |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| symbol         | Normally, the `backtester` application loads          |
|                | symbols from a previously executed batch, the symbol  |
|                | parameter changes this behavior by selecting a        |
|                | specific symbol to back-test during the batch         |
|                | timeframe (even if the stock was not picked by        |
|                | a scanner during `trader` session). It is possible    |
|                | to include several --symbol parameters in a single    |
|                | `backtester` application execution.                   |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| strict         | This option, limits the back-tested symbol to         |
|                | symbol that were actually traded during a session.    |
|                | The option is helpful to speed up back-test run       |
|                | during initial strategy development or improvement    |
|                | session.                                              |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| duration       | The option over-rides the initial duration specified  |
|                | in the back-tested `tradeplan`. The option is less    |
|                | relevant for tradeplans with multiple trade windows.  |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| debug          | When a sybmol is select for debug, then the debug     |
|                | flag will be passed as True for the strategy          |
|                | `run()` function. Based on the strategy implementation|
|                | additional logging may be provided.                   |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+


Browser-base tool
*****************

If you used `liu quickstart` wizard, or watched the intro video_ you've already seen
the browser based tool in action.

.. _video: https://youtu.be/rVwFCbHsbIY

To run the tool type:

.. code-block:: bash

    streamlit run https://raw.github.com/amor71/LiuAlgoTrader/master/analysis/backtester_ui.py

Once the browser opens, it would look like:

.. image:: /images/streamlit-backtest-1.png
    :width: 800
    :align: left
    :alt: *backtester* streamlit start sample

The browser-based UI supports two types on back-testing sessions:

1. Re-running strategies for a specific trading session. Similarly to the command-line tool,
2. Re-run strategies on a past date, **even if no past trading session took place on that date**. This capability is not yet exposed on the command-line tool.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. When selecting the "`back-test against the whole day`" option , **scanners** will be called w/ a `back-time` schedule (vs. real-time),
2. Scanners are expected to support running in `back_time` mode (see scanners section).
3. The built-in scanner supports back-time mode - if no data exists in the database for that specific date, the framework would load OHLC data for all traded stock on the select date, and the day before. Please note that this process may take between long minutes to couple of hours (on-time) depending on your network connection & equipment.
4. Instead of having the scanners trigger loading of data, it is advised to use the `market_miner` tool to pre-load data in off-hours before running a back-test session on a day without any data.

To see an example of the tool, refer back to `liu quickstart` guide.

Analysis using the browser based tool
*************************************

While the brwoser-based tool is less configurable than the 
command-line alternative, it does include a basic analysis 
tool for visualizng day-trading sessions. Select the `analyer` 
app on the app selector drop-box and enter a batch-id to visualize. 

IF you have used `liu quickstart` before, you should have the 
batch-id "2398380c-5146-4b58-843a-a50c458c8071" avaliable in your 
database.
